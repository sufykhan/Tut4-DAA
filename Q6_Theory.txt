Q6. What are the major differences/ similarities between Greedy and DP? Make a comparison table. 

Ans - 

Greedy --> (1)
DP --> (2)

**Differences**

(1) In this method, we take the solution which gives the best answer at the spur of the moment and assume that it gives the overall correct answer.
(2) There are subproblems to the problem and we solve them step by step by using subproblems and get the final answer.

(1) It may not give the optimal solution.
(2) It always gives the optimal solution.

(1) Memory requirement is quite less and we donâ€™t reuse the values calculated once.
(2) Memoization is used which may take up a lot of memory.

(1) It gives a faster solution mostly.
(2) It is a bit slow in comparison to the Greedy.

(1) Example - Indian currency coin exchange.
(2) Example - Coin change using any coin denominations.


**Similarities**

(1,2) Divide and conquer technique used in DP as well as Greedy techniques.
(1,2) Both give optimization.
(1,2) The problem that is solved by these methods should have optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
(1,2) There are various problems that may be solved using both techniques.
